<!-- doc-id: changelog -->

- `make test-php` and `make lint-bindings` find PHP without an argument: the default of `PHP` and of `PHP_CONFIG` is
  the path that `command -v` gives. Before, the default was the bare name `php`, which ext-php-rs reads as a path of a
  file and fails with "php executable not found at php".

- Every tracked document is a pair of an English file `X.md` and a Korean file `X.ko.md`. `AGENTS.ko.md` and
  `docs/spec/media-type.ko.md` are added. Both files of a pair hold the same marker `doc-id` in their first line, and
  the Korean file holds `source-sha256`, the sha256 of its English file, in its second line.

- `composer.lock` is tracked, so `composer install` installs the PHPUnit that runs the tests of the PHP extension at one
  pinned version.

- The bindings build and load on macOS: `.cargo/config.toml` tells the macOS linker to leave the symbols of PHP and
  Node undefined, which the runtime gives when it loads the library, and `make test-node` and `make test-php` name the
  library that Cargo builds by the extension of the platform (`dylib` on macOS, `so` on Linux). Before, the PHP
  extension did not link on macOS and both recipes named a `.so` file that Cargo does not write there.

- `scripts/binding.mts` clones the checkout that Cargo made of the pinned binding commit into `var/binding/<commit>`
  and no longer copies its files. `binding check` reads its own commit from its Git checkout and compares it with the
  commit of `Cargo.lock` (CK-20); with a copy of the files it found no commit, and `make bindings-check` failed.

- `make test-node` packs the platform package of the addon of the machine as a release does and installs it with the Node
  package, which holds no addon (GN-3c).
